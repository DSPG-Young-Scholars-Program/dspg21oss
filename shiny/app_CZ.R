                                            it is challenging to account for software that is developed outside of traditional business contexts. Moreover, while

                                            Open Source Software (OSS) through the use of public administrative data. OSS refers to computer software with
                                            its source code shared with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study,
                                            change, or distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Over the past few years, our team has aimed 
                                            to measure how much OSS is in use (stock), how much is created (flow), who is developing these tools (based on sectors, institutions, 
                                            and organizations) as well as how OSS is shared across these various institutions. In past Data Science for the Public Good projects, we developed procedures to 
                                            classify users into sectors, but very little work to date examines how different types of software are used within and across these sectors.

                                            and evaluating how these different types of software are used within and across economic sectors. 
                                            Developing a procedure to classify repositories into categories will allow the NCSES to better determine the effect that variations in software 
                                            may have on OSS contribution activity, collaboration tendencies in networked ecosystems, or on the overall cost of OSS projects.")
